# MakeyBoT Robot Files
The MakeyBot Project is a STEAM activity to create you own small flat 3D Printed Robot.  The goal is to learn some 3D Print CAD skills, mostly explained using TinkerCAD, but any CAD tool can be used. Aditionally, it is to learn some simple circuit and wireing skills, where you connect some simple LEDeyes, other blinking LED, RGB LES and a circuit with a servo to wave an arm. Obiously, with this circuit, you will need to learn some Microcontroller or processor coding skills.  There are examples and tutorials using an Arduino, Raspberry Pico, Raspberry Pi 3,4,5, but really you could use any Microcontroller/processor, including the Adafruit Circuit Playground or MicroBit.

### Small MakeyBot Template Features:
- [Link to TinkerCAD Small STEAM Clown MakeyBot Robot "Holes" template](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hcsn7VDLKw3-steam-clown-makeybot-holes) 

Add these as "Holes" to your MakeyBot Robot.  
1. Add them to your CAD design
2. Place them where you want
3. Select and "sink" below the plate a little (like 1 mm)
4. Select them all and turn them into holes
5. Then select all the parts of your Robot and group them
6. Then export as an STL.
